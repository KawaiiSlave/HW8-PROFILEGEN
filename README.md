# Profile Generator



This application takes user prompted info, and generates html based on that info to display it in addition with an axios call to github then creating your own custom profile layout.


## Resources, and how it works
																										
																										
This application uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Node together to complete its tasks. When the application is ran with "index.js" in the command line you'll be prompted to choose you're favorite color scheme, and enter a Github profile name. Afterwards you will be granted a custom profile based on those credentials, and those alone! :P
